In this part we import the bootstrap grid css and will make the layout without styling, just using some placeholder and bootstrap-grid.

- You import the bootstrap css in `assets/bootstrap-4.1.3-dist/css/bootstrap-grid.min.css`
- We here make a skeleton for navbar with some styling
- The styling i used is using atom css kind of and per components
